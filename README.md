# Eight-Bit, Two-Function Calculator

This project is an eight-bit, two-function calculator designed to perform addition and subtraction using Verilog. This calculator is implemented on a DE10-Lite FPGA board with a keypad interface.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Unit (AU):** Performs addition and subtraction operations.
- **Input Unit (IU):** Handles input from the keypad.
- **Output Unit (OU):** Displays results on the LED and seven-segment displays.
- **Control Unit (CU):** Manages the state transitions for the calculator's operation.

## Lessons Learned
- Designed, built, and tested combinational and sequential logic circuits using Verilog HDL.
- Implemented and verified the functionality on an FPGA platform.

| 9         | 9         | 9-9       | 000    |
| 86        | 125       | 86-125    | -039   |
| 86        | 125       | 86+125    | -045   |

## Unresolved Problems
1. Some LEDs are partially on; grounding those LEDs could fix this issue.
2. After pressing * for negative numbers, three digits must be entered. The hex display shows gibberish numbers until the third digit is entered.
