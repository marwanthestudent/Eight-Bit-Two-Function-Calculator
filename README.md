# Eight-Bit-Two-Function-Calculator
This project is an eight-bit, two-function calculator designed to perform addition and subtraction using Verilog. Developed as part of the Digital Logic Design course at UTA, this calculator is implemented on a DE10-Lite FPGA board with a keypad interface.

Features:

	• Arithmetic Unit (AU): Performs addition and subtraction operations.
	• Input Unit (IU): Handles input from the keypad.
	• Output Unit (OU): Displays results on the LED and seven-segment displays.
	• Control Unit (CU): Manages the state transitions for the calculator’s operation.

Key Learnings:

	•	Designed, built, and tested combinational and sequential logic circuits using Verilog.
	•	Implemented and verified the functionality on an FPGA platform.
